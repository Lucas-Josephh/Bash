            I studied computer science, taking
            the technology track in my junior and senior years of high school, then completing a two-year technical degree
            in Digital Computer Systems and Networks, and finally a bachelor's degree in Robotics
            Prototyping, so I have a bachelor's degree.

                Techno is a genre of electronic dance music[2] (EDM) which is generally produced for use in a
                continuous DJ set, with tempos being in the range from 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm). The
                central rhythm is typically in common time (44) and often characterized by a repetitive
                four on the floor beat.[3] Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines,
                sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from
                the 1980s such as Roland's Roland TR-808 and Roland TR-909 are highly prized, and software
                emulations of such retro instruments are popular in this style. Much of the instrumentation
                in techno is used to emphasize the role of rhythm over other musical aspects. Vocals and
                melodies are uncommon. The use of sound synthesis in developing distinctive timbres tends to
                feature more prominently. Typical harmonic practices found in other forms of music are often 
                ignored in favor of repetitive sequences of notes. More generally the creation of techno is heavily
                dependent on music production technology. Use of the term "techno" to refer to a type of electroni
                music originated in Germany in the early 1980s.[4] In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation
                Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, the term came to be associated with a form of EDM produced in
                Detroit.[5][6] Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synth-pop by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio
                Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house, electro, and funk.
                Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes[8] relevant to life in contemporary
                American society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference.[9][10] The music
                produced in the mid-to-late 1980s by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as
                The Belleville Three), along with Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter, James Pennington and others is viewed as the
                first wave of techno from Detroit. After the success of house music in Europe, techno grew in popularity in
                the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands. Regional variants quickly evolved and by the early
                1990s techno subgenres such as acid, hardcore, bleep, ambient, and dub techno had developed. Music journalists
                and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term, so a clear distinction can be made between
                sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.
